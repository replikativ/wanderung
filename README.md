# wanderung

Migration tool for Datahike from and to other databases.

## Usage

Make sure your source and target databases exist. For this tool to run you need to have Clojure [CLI tools](https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli). You can run the migration on the commandline:

```bash
clj -M:migrate -s datomic-cloud.edn -t datahike-pg.edn -d datomic-cloud:datahike
```

Use `clj -M:migrate -h` for further instructions. See the `*-example.edn` files for `dataomic-cloud` and `datahike-pg` example configurations.

Alternatively open your Clojure project, add `io.lambdaforge/wanderung` to your dependencies, and start a REPL:

```clojure
(require '[wanderung.core :as w])

(def datomic-cfg {:name "your-database"
                  :server-type :ion
                  :region      "eu-west-1"
                  :system      "your-system"
                  :endpoint    "http://entry.your-system.eu-west-1.datomic.net:8182/"
                  :proxy-port  8182})

(def datahike-cfg {:store {:backend :file
                           :path "/your-data-path"}
                   :name "from-datomic"
                   :schema-flexibility :write
                   :keep-history? true}) 
;; if the database doesn't exist, wanderung will create a Datahike database
                           
(w/migrate [:datomic-cloud :datahike] datomic-cfg datahike-cfg)
```
